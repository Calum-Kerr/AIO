    "# Week 4 : Writing an Evolutionary Algorithm with DEAP\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to use the Python library DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) library to build an EA. You can access all the documentation for DEAP (including examples) at the link below.\n",
    "https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use this package throughout the module so it is important you go through this step by step to build up an understanding of how implement an EA using this  DEAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will keep it fairly simple and use the pre-made implementations of EAs that come with DEAP. Next week, we will break this down and use DEAP functions to design our own EAs\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this tutorial you will**:\n",
    "-  learn how to set up the EASimple algorithm from DEAP to solve the OneMax problem\n",
    "-  run the algorithm under various parameter settings to understand how the parameters influence the algorithm performance\n",
    "-  set up a new instance of EASimple to solve knapsack problems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extension**:\n",
    "If you are feeling confident, you can write some new code to use the EASimple to solve some function optimisation problems using a binary representation\n",
    "\n",
    "**The OneMax problem**\n",
    "Recall from the lecture that the goal is to start with a string with *n* bits in it (0/1) and optimise the number of 1 bits in the string. Obviously for a string of length n the maximum fitness (number of 1s) is equal to *n*\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this is an easy problem for a human to solve, the only information the EA has is a value (equal to the number of 1s) which is assigned to each string a fitness value\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What should you do?\n",
    "Work through this tutorial cell by cell: you will need to read the text and look carefully at the examples and explanations given. You will need to run the code cells as you come across them. Some of the cells will contain instructions asking you to write or run code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial breaks down the code into small chunks to help with understanding. A full listing of the code (without the explanations) can also be found in the Moodle folder (FullListing-OneMaxEASimple)\n",

    "\n",
    "**This may look a bit complicated at first sight but we will re-use the same code over and over again each time we create a new algorithm so don't worry!**\n",
    "\n",
    "DEAP provides a  convenient method for creating **individuals** (chromosomes) that represent solutions to the problen we want to solve. Each individual is associated with a fitness value that denotes its quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In DEAP, we must first define how we want to create individuals using the **deap.creator** function which creates an individual as a container of *attributes* (genes/variables) of a specific type, associated with  a fitness value.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very flexible and can be used to make individuals of different types (e.g. bitstrings, integers etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will first create the template for a fitness function - we choose the name *FitnessMax*. It will inherit the Fitness class of the deap.base module and contains an additional attribute called *weights* which enables you to specify whether the fitness function is maximisation or minimisation. It is designed to be flexible in that you can add multiple fitness objectives if you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we just have one objective  - maximise the number of 1s - so we give it one value. The value is set to **1 if the objective is to maximised**, and to  **-1 if it is to be minimised**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have to create the class that represents an individual - we will just call it *Individual* (or any name we choose): this is a generic class that defines what type of data structure will be used to define an individual ( a *list* in this case), and what fitness class is associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second parameter *list* denotes that the individual will be made of up a *list* of attributes. We can use a list for most applications we will cover in the module. We haven't told it yet however what type of atttributes will form the list - that comes later.\n",

    "\n",
    "The toolbox is a key design component of a DEAP algorithm. We always create an instance of a toolbox then \"register\" with the toolbox what kind of indiviudals we want, how create a population, and what operators we want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nice thing about is DEAP is the toolbox includes lots of inbuilt operators (selection, mutation, crossover etc) which makes it very easy to define an algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "All the objects we will use on our way, an individual, the population, as well as all functions, operators, and arguments will be stored in a DEAP container called Toolbox.  The 'register' method adds content.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First we define what kind of **variables** an indiviudal has, i.e what kind of attributes will be in the list that make up an individual: here we are going to create an individual made of boolean values, each of which are randomly set to 0 or 1  - see line 4 in the cell below where we tell DEAP to use the Python method random.randint to generate numbers in the set (0,1).   We can create any convenient name to refer to this attribute type in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we define an  *individual* (line 9) : for OneMax, an individual is a list of *n* variables each holding a boolean value.  Let's assume we want to maximise the number of 1s in a string that has **100** values:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our individuals will be generated using the function initRepeat()  - that is use the same method for each variable. Its first argument is a container class, in our example the Individual class we defined in the previous section. This container will be filled using the method *attr_bool()*, provided as second argument, and will contain 100 integers (randomly generated as specified above), as specified using the third argument. \n",

    "\n",
    "Once we have created an *individual*, we tell DEAP that we want a *population* which  consists of a list of *individuals*.  We tell it what size we want the population to be later. The use of init.repeat just tells DEAP to use the same creation method for each individual in the population\n",

    "In the lectures in week 2 and week 3 we discussed the Knapsack problem - how to select *n* items from a set such that the value of the items is maximised while remaining within some weight/cost limit.  A solution to this problem can be represented in exactly the same way as the OneMax problem, i.e. as a string 1010101010 where 1 at position *i* represents that item *i*  should be included in the selection, and 0 that it shouldn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:  a string 10110 is interpreted as \"take the 1st item, the 3rd item and the 4th item\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can use exactly the same EA to solve this problem as for OneMax, i.e the **representation** and the **operators** are identical. All we need to do is write a new **fitness function** to evaluate the quality of a solution in a different manner.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Converting the binary individual to a float**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use almost the same code as in the previous example to solve this problem as our individuals are binary strings\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since the function F2 takes a float variable, to get a fitness value we need to convert the binary string to a float. \n",
    "\n",
    "DEAP implements a convenient way of converting a binary individual to a floating point number through the use of *Decorators*: a decorator is a very powerful feature that helps to control very precise things during an evolution without changing anything in the algorithm or operators. A decorator is a wrapper that is called instead of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert that binary individual to a float, we can *decorate* the evaluation function as shown below: the decorator takes 3 values: the *min* and *max* values of the range the number needs to be converted to, and the *number of bits* in the individual\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever the registered evaluation function is called,the decorator will change the binary individual to a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to import an additional library \n",
    "\n",
    "**import deap.benchmarks.binary**\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we call the decorator which tells *evaluate* to convert the binary stting to a float using the inbuilt *bin2float* function\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the value of x to be in the range 0,1 and use an individual with 50 bits. Hence the code looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**toolbox.decorate(\"evaluate\", deap.benchmarks.binary.bin2float(0,1,50))**\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to define an evaluation function and register it, just as above. This is show below.  As we added the decorator to 'evaluate',  the evaluation function that we define and register will automatically convert the individual to a float.\n",
    "\n",

The decorator automatically converts this to float for us so we can then call **F2** passing that float. Notice we have to  pass individual[0] as the decorator is designed to be flexible and return a tuple  of floats...we only have one value this case\n",
